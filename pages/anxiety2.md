*10/19/2020 - 10/26/2020 ; I've been having constant attacks everyday. Although it is less severe than those I had on the first onset, nothing seems to stop these attacks. I've been prescribed and been taking Escitalopram for about a week now. I think it's working but it's making me real drowsy. I can now sleep for a full 12 hours, literally, and not feel rested. 

*10/27/2020 - I feel a bit better today, I have constantly browsed the net for answers in stopping these attacks, I came across this website called "nothingworks.weebly.com" and it basically told me that to stop anxiety, you have to make no effort to stop it. You gotta be contented in not finding the exit, because generally nothing is wrong with you. Nothing is wrong with me. This thought made me stop for a moment and think. Let's just drop all the worries we were having and just live as we were before. There is no way of turning back, because nothing's really changed.

# Dealing with anxiety

## This log is regarding my now frequently occuring anxiety attacks

*10/12/2020 - This was my first experience with an anxiety attack. I was on the way to work, riding the subway, when I noticed I had trouble breathing. I tried to remove my mask to catch my breath but I could not. I felt my heart beating really fast, and then suddenly my chest started tightening. At the same area, I felt a burning/warm sensation. It was as if my heart was gonna stop pounding at any time. Scared me shitless. I felt light headed after a few minutes and felt like passing out. I hurriedly exited the next stop, and seeked help from the staff. The said staff made me sit at the benches and talked to me during the whole ordeal (thanks Emil). Called my folks to come pick me up and drive me home.
*10/14/2020 - This was my second experience with anxiety attack. It was after a night shift, and I hadn't had enough sleep. I decided to eat downstairs for a bit and vaped. After finishing my meal, I noticed the same symptoms. I tried controlling my breath for about 30 mins, but my heart rate was still super fast and even rising. (smartwatch recorded 175 peak). As I think I was about to pass out, I hesitatingly called 911, for EMS. After what felt like an eternity with a throbbing heart and difficulty of breathing, the ambulance arrived and performed a quick check up. They noted that my heart rate was a bit fast, other than that, oxygen levels and blood pressure were fine. Was advised to make an appointment with the family doctor.
*10/15/2020 - Third episode of anxiety attack. I was sitting at work, after having lunch. Noticed that I was having difficulty in breathing and chest discomfort. I have tried to control my breathing again for about an hour but to no avail. Palms wet with cold sweats. I waited for my relief and decided to go to the Operations room for help. After a few more minutes of calming myself down, they told me I'd be better off going home and go get checked. I took the train going to dad's place, all while thinking I'm about to pass out and fighting it. Met with dad and waited another hour for mom, while breathing hard. We went to the nearest walk in clinic, and I got checked by a young Doctor named Dr. Agarwal; gave me some prescription for Ativan, 4 tablets and advised to take it on the onset of anxiety attack. My vitals seemed to be ok. I don't know what's wrong with me.

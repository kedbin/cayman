## Documentation
##### According to my research, it seems that documentation is considered an integral skill in IT. This serves as a log of changes which immensely helps in troubleshooting errors. This also lets users and co-developers see recent updates to your program/site/project or see the process of how it was done. Moving forward, I shall document updates and bugfixes in this section.

* 10/09/2020 - Changed banner title, and successfully added a home nav button. Created the documentation page
* 10/15/2020 - Forked astrocites and created my front page with it. I have temporarily removed the nav bar, and will re-use it once i have more content. Also revamped the color scheme. Added anxiety episodes log.
